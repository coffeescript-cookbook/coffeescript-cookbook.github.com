title: Get Days Between two Dates
chapter: Dates and Times

h2. Problem

You need to find how much seconds minutes, hours, days, months or years has passed between two dates.

h2. Solution

Use JavaScript's Date function  getTime(). Which provides how much time in miliseconds has passed since 01/01/1970:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
DAY = 1000 * 60 * 60  * 24

d1 = new Date('02/01/2011')
d2 = new Date('02/06/2011')

days_passed = Math.round((d2.getTime() - d1.getTime()) / DAY)
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Discussion

Using miliseconds makes the life easier to avoid overflow mistakes with Dates. So we first calculate how much miliseconds has a day.
Then, given two distincit dates, just get the diference in miliseconds betwen two dates and then divide by how much miliseconds has a 
day. It will get you the days between two distinct dates.

If you'd like to calculate the hours between two dates objects you can do that just by dividing the diference in miliseconds by the
convertion of miliseconds to hours. The same goes to minutes and seconds.

{% highlight coffeescript %}
HOUR = 1000 * 60 * 60

d1 = new Date('02/01/2011 02:20')
d2 = new Date('02/06/2011 05:20')

hour_passed = Math.round((d2.getTime() - d1.getTime()) / HOUR)
{% endhighlight %}
