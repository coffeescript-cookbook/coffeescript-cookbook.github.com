h2. Problem

You need to find the largest value contained in an array

h2. Solution

Use javascript's Math.max, along with a for loop

{% highlight coffeescript %}
max = Math.max(max or= num, num) for num in [12,32,11,67,1,3]
# => 67
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Discussion

or= takes care of the initial assignment
