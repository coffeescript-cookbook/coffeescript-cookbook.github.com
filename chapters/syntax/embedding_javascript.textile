h2. Problem

You want to include some found/pre-written JavaScript code inline with your CoffeeScript

h2. Solution

Wrap the JavaScript with backticks:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
`function greet(name) {
alert("Hello "+name);
}`

# Back to CoffeeScript
greet "Coffee"
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Discussion

This is a simple way to integrate small snippets of JavaScript code into your CoffeeScript without converting it over to use CoffeeScript syntax. As shown in the "CoffeeScript Language Reference":http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#embedded you can mix to the two languages to a certain extent:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
hello = `function (name) {
alert("Hello "+name)
}`
hello "Coffee"

{% endhighlight %}
Here the "hello" variable is still in CoffeeScript, but is assigned a function written in JavaScript.
