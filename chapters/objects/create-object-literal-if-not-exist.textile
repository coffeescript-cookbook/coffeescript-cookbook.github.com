title: Create an object literal if it does not already exist
chapter: Objects
---

h2. Problem

You want to initialize an object literal, but you do not want to overwrite the object if it already exists.


h2. Solution

Use the Existential operator

{% highlight coffeescript %}
window.MY_NAMESPACE ?= {} 
{% endhighlight %}


h2. Discussion

This is equivalent to the following JavaScript:

{% highlight javascript %}
window.MY_NAMESPACE = window.MY_NAMESPACE || {};
{% endhighlight %}

Common JavaScript technique, using object literal to define a namespace. This saves us from clobbering the namespace if it already exists.
